# pull

Clojure has powerful syntax for expressing nested data structures as trees.

Trees are extremely useful for user-interfaces, configuration and data transfer (EDN, JSON and XML).

However trees force a single perspective on the data. The 'root' is privileged. It is impossible to design tree models to support multiple perspectives.

That's why we prefer to store data in table rows, with links (foreign keys) between them. A database is agnostic about the perspective from which the data is to be viewed.

To define a specific perspective on data we define a query. Now we are back to a single perspective, a tree is an ideal container for that data.

This is an insight that a number of people have had. Datomic's pull API is an early example. David Nolen has taken inspiration from this to create Om Next's query expressions. However, the idea is too valuable and applicable to be enmeshed in narrower applications.

## Usage

Declare some state:

```clojure
'{:name "pull"
  :routes {:main ["/" :abc]}
  :vhosts {"http://localhost:8080" ^:ref [:routes :main]}
  :server {:port 8080
           :vhosts [^:ref [:vhosts "http://localhost:8080"]]}}
```

Write a query:

```clojure
[:name :vhosts]
```

Get a result:

```clojure
{:name "pull" :vhosts {"http://localhost:8080" ["/" :abc]}}
```

## Queries

Queries a vectors, containing the entries you wish to pull out of the state.

## References

Note that the state contains references, indicated with the metadata tag `^:ref`. These are similar to Datomic lookup-refs or Om Next's idents. These references are vectors corresponding to the path you might use in a `get-in` function to access other parts of the state.

## Joins

Joins (sub-queries) are also supported by providing a map in place of a keyword in a query.
